# EscPosEncoder is now ReceiptPrinterEncoder

[â†’ ReceiptPrinterEncoder](https://github.com/NielsLeenheer/ReceiptPrinterEncoder)

This library has been deprecated. A new version is available under the name `ReceiptPrinterEncoder` and is backwards-compatible with this library.

If you are still using an older version of `EscPosEncoder` and need help, please use the look at [the documentation for version 2.1](https://github.com/NielsLeenheer/EscPosEncoder/blob/v2.1.0/README.md).

If you have upgraded to version 3.0 of this library, understand that it currently is currently just a wrapper around the new `ReceiptPrinterEncoder` library. For instructions on how to use it look at [the documentation for ReceiptPrinterEncoder](https://github.com/NielsLeenheer/ReceiptPrinterEncoder).
